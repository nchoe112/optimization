The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem focused on determining the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers. In this rendition of the problem, 7 sites with a random inventory between 1 and 10 were placed randomly on a 100 by 100 grid.
